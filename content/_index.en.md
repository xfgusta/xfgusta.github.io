Welcome to my personal blog! I'm Gustavo, a computing and open-source enthusiast. I program in Perl, Python, C, and I'm currently learning C++. I contribute to several open-source projects, especially Fedora, where I act as a [translator](https://translate.fedoraproject.org/user/xfgusta/) and [package maintainer](https://src.fedoraproject.org/user/xfgusta/projects).

Here, I plan to share posts about computing, poetry, books, and whatever else comes to mind.
